                        <h3 id="GroundDash">GROUND DASH</h3>
                        Ground Dash is performed when <b>INITIATING</b> a dash from the ground regardless of where the
                        dash leads you.
                        <ul>
                            <li>By default Ground Dash's Cooldown is 0.8s
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ground Dashing off a ledge will prevent you from replenishing your Dash CD
                                        leaving you helpless in the air</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Ground Dash is heavily influenced by ground friction. Surfaces like [ICE] has little to

                            <li>Neutral Ground Dash will always give you a forwards dash input</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="AirDash">AIR DASH</h3>
                        AIR Dash is performed when <b>INITIATING</b> a dash from the air regardless of where the dash
                        leads you.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Air Dashing covers much more distance than Ground Dashing due to the lack of air
                                friction
                                <ul>

                                        Air Dash increases the ground state's DecelerationTime dramatically for the
                                        first 0.2s of activation. This knowledge is crucial to understanding the timing

                                Air Dash doesn't have a Cooldown, you cannot dash until you reach a ground state

                            <li>Neutral Air Dash will make you dash where the camera is pointing regardless of XYZ axis

                                    <li>
                                        This implies that if you dash directly on the Y axis you will not cover much
                                        ground horizontally, but much more vertically.
                                    </li>

                                        Holding forwards before an Air Dash will favor horizontal velocity and add a
                                        forwards vector to your dash making it easier to <a href="#Wave Dash">[WAVEDASH]</a> even if the camera

                        <p>To perform a wave dash, Air Dash diagonally into the ground and jump within 0.2s of the dash's initiation.</p>
                        <p>To reach the highest speed of wavedashes you have to juggle having the right angle and timing your jump input as early as possible when touching the ground</p>

                        <p>Extended Dashes from Ground Dashes are performed by jumping 0.8 seconds after dashing, keeping the superdash momentum and having another dash in the pocket this is indicated by the character being highlighted when the Ground Dash goes off cooldown</p>

                            Global cool down (GCD) is the time you have to wait between using GCD abilities. Each

                            <li>This system is common in MMORPG's. Other games might use notions like
                                "startup/windup" and
